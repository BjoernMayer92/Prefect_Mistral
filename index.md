## Welcome to GitHub Pages
Guide on how to run prefect workflows on a dask slurmcluster deployed on Mistral from DKRZ ([Link](https://docs.dkrz.de/doc/mistral/index.html)) 



# Setting up Slurm Clsuter

1. Start a dask Slurmcluster.

    Use either jupyterhub([Link](https://jupyterhub.dkrz.de/)) to start a dask slurm cluster or run it as a script [Link](./src/start_dask_slurmcluster.py) on mistral directly. For more info check [Link](https://docs.dkrz.de/blog/2020/dask_jobqueue.html)
```markdown
cluster = SLURMCluster(name=name,
                       queue = queue,
                       project= project,
                       cores=cores, 
                       interface=interface,
                       memory=memory,
                       walltime = walltime,
                       scheduler_options={"dashboard_address": ":{}".format(str(port))})

client = Client(cluster)

cluster.scale(workers)
```
When using jupyterhub you should be able to view the dashboard directly in the browser. When running a cluster in the terminal you need to forward the port via ssh tunneling to your local PC and should then be able to view the dask dashboard.

The output of client should look similar to this:

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/BjoernMayer92/Prefect_Mistral/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
